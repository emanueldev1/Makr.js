**Makr.js** is an open-source project in active development, aiming to become a modular engine for building modern website builders using **React**, **Next.js**, **Yjs**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

</div>

---

## 🚀 Vision

Makr.js was created to provide a solid, flexible foundation for building visual editors on the web.  
The goal is to let developers craft their own builder — from a simple block editor to a full collaborative design platform — without having to start from scratch.

---

## ⚙️ What It Aims to Do

- **Full React & Next.js Compatibility**  
  Support for both *Server-Side Rendering (SSR)* and *Client-Side Rendering (CSR)*.

- **Real-Time Collaboration**  
  Integration with **Yjs** for live editing and synchronization between multiple users, with backend-agnostic support.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  The project will be divided into packages — a `core`, a default `ui`, integration adapters, and optional collaboration modules.

- **Customizable Interface**  
  The default interface will be built with **shadcn/ui** and **TailwindCSS**, but developers can easily replace or extend it.

- **Smart Save System**  
  Manual and automatic saving with change detection, *draft* and *published* modes, and support for custom backend integrations.

- **Advanced Drag & Drop + Nested Components**  
  Components can contain other editable components, with configurable drop zones and nesting.

- **Simple & Extensible API**  
  Designed so developers can register new components, define custom props, and extend functionality with minimal friction.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

Makr.js isn’t meant to be “just another page builder.”  
It’s a **foundation** for developers who want to build their own.  

It provides the essentials — rendering, synchronization, editing, saving, and extensibility — while leaving full creative control to you.

The project values:
- **Framework agnosticism** – works with different backends and setups.  
- **Modularity** – each piece can stand alone or be replaced.  
- **Collaboration** – real-time teamwork built into the core.  
- **Extensibility** – easy to customize, extend, and publish.

## 📅 Current Status

Makr.js is currently **in active development**.  
The core architecture, adapters, and base UI are being designed and prototyped.  
No npm packages have been released yet — the focus is on defining the foundation and long-term structure.
